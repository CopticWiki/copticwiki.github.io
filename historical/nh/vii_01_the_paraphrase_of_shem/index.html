					<p class="english">I heard a voice saying to me, “Shem, since <span class="greek">ἐπειδη</span> you are from an unmixed <span class="greek">ἀκέραιος</span> power <span class="greek">δύναμις</span> and you are the first being upon the earth, hear and understand <span class="greek">νοεῖν</span> what I shall say to you first concerning the great powers <span class="greek">δύναμις</span> who were in existence in the beginning, before I appeared. There was Light and Darkness and there was Spirit <span class="greek">πνεῦμα</span> between them. Since <span class="greek">ἐπειδή</span> your root fell into forgetfulness, (i.e.) he who was the unbegotten <span class="greek">ἀγέννητον</span> Spirit <span class="greek">πνεῦμα</span>, I am revealing <span class="greek">φανεροῦν</span> to you the truth <span class="greek">ἀκρίβεια</span> about the powers <span class="greek">δύναμις</span>.

And the darkness was wind in waters [while] possessing the mind <span class="greek">νοῦς</span> wrapped in a chaotic fire. And the Spirit <span class="greek">πνεῦμα</span> between them was a gentle, humble light. These are the three roots. They reigned each in themselves, alone.

					<p class="english">And when he (i.e., Darkness) had moved the light of the Spirit <span class="greek">πνεῦμα</span> appeared to him.

He caused his mind <span class="greek">νοῦς</span> to take on form in a member <span class="greek">μέλος</span> of the parts of the Spirit <span class="greek">πνεῦμα</span>, thinking that, by staring at his evil <span class="greek">κακία</span>, he would be able to make the Spirit <span class="greek">πνεῦμα</span> equal (to himself).
