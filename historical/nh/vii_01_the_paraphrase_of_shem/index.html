					<p class="english">I heard a voice saying to me, “Shem, since <span class="greek">ἐπειδη</span> you are from an unmixed <span class="greek">ἀκέραιος</span> power <span class="greek">δύναμις</span> and you are the first being upon the earth, hear and understand <span class="greek">νοεῖν</span> what I shall say to you first concerning the great powers <span class="greek">δύναμις</span> who were in existence in the beginning, before I appeared. There was Light and Darkness and there was Spirit <span class="greek">πνεῦμα</span> between them. Since <span class="greek">ἐπειδή</span> your root fell into forgetfulness, (i.e.) he who was the unbegotten <span class="greek">ἀγέννητον</span> Spirit <span class="greek">πνεῦμα</span>, I am revealing <span class="greek">φανεροῦν</span> to you the truth <span class="greek">ἀκρίβεια</span> about the powers <span class="greek">δύναμις</span>.

And the darkness was wind in waters [while] possessing the mind <span class="greek">νοῦς</span> wrapped in a chaotic fire. And the Spirit <span class="greek">πνεῦμα</span> between them was a gentle, humble light. These are the three roots. They reigned each in themselves, alone.

					<p class="english">And when he (i.e., Darkness) had moved the light of the Spirit <span class="greek">πνεῦμα</span> appeared to him.

He caused his mind <span class="greek">νοῦς</span> to take on form in a member <span class="greek">μέλος</span> of the parts of the Spirit <span class="greek">πνεῦμα</span>, thinking that, by staring at his evil <span class="greek">κακία</span>, he would be able to make the Spirit <span class="greek">πνεῦμα</span> equal (to himself).

					<p class="english">O <span class="greek">ὦ</span> Shem, the disturbance <span class="greek">κίνησις</span> which occurred at my wish happened in order that <span class="greek">ἵνα</span> Nature <span class="greek">φύσις</span> might become empty. For <span class="greek">γάρ</span> the wrath of the Darkness subsided. O <span class="greek">ὦ</span> Shem, the Darkness' mouth was shut. No longer <span class="greek">οὐκέτι</span> does the light which shone for the creation <span class="greek">κτίσις</span> appear in it, according to <span class="greek">κατά</span> my will. And when Nature <span class="greek">φύσις</span> had said that its wish was fulfilled, then <span class="greek">τότε</span> every form <span class="greek">εἶδος</span> was engulfed by the waters in prideful ignorance. She (i.e., Nature <span class="greek">φύσις</span>) turned her dark orifice and cast from her the power <span class="greek">δύναμις</span> of fire which was in her from the beginning through the rubbing <span class="greek">τρίβη</span> of the Darkness. It (masc.) lifted itself up and shone upon the whole creation <span class="greek">κτίσις</span> instead of the righteous one <span class="greek">δίκαιος</span>. And all her forms <span class="greek">μορφή</span> sent forth a power <span class="greek">δύναμις</span> like a flame of fire up to heaven as a help <span class="greek">βοήθεια</span> to the corrupted light, which had lifted itself up. For <span class="greek">γάρ</span> they were members <span class="greek">μέλος</span> of the chaotic fire. And she did not know that she had harmed <span class="greek">βλάπτειν</span> herself. When she cast forth the power <span class="greek">δύναμις</span>, the power <span class="greek">δύναμις</span> which she possessed, she cast it forth from the joints. It was the demon <span class="greek">δαίμων</span>, a deceiver <span class="greek">πλάνος</span>, who stirred up the womb <span class="greek">μήτρα</span> in every form <span class="greek">εἶδος</span>—. And in her ignorance, as if <span class="greek">ὡς</span> she were doing a great thing, she granted <span class="greek">χαρίζειν</span> the demons <span class="greek">δαίμων</span> and the winds a star each. For <span class="greek">γάρ</span> without <span class="greek">χωρίς</span> wind and star nothing happens upon the earth. For <span class="greek">γάρ</span> it is filled by every power <span class="greek">δύναμις</span> after <span class="greek">ἐπεί</span> they were released from the Darkness and the fire and the power <span class="greek">δύναμις</span> and the light. For <span class="greek">γάρ</span> in the place where their darkness and their fire were mixed with each other beasts <span class="greek">θηρίον</span> were brought forth. And (it was in) the place of the Darkness, and the fire, and the power <span class="greek">δύναμις</span> of the mind <span class="greek">νοῦς</span>, and the light, that human beings came into existence from the Spirit <span class="greek">πνεῦμα</span>. The thought of the Light, my eye, exists not in every man. For <span class="greek">γάρ</span> before the flood <span class="greek">κατακλυσμός</span> came from the winds and the demons <span class="greek">δαίμων</span>, &lt;evil&gt; came to men. But <span class="greek">δέ</span> yet <span class="greek">ἔτι</span>, in order that the power <span class="greek">δύναμις</span> which is in the tower <span class="greek">πύργος</span> might be brought forth, and might rest upon the earth, then <span class="greek">τότε</span> Nature <span class="greek">φύσις</span>, which had been disturbed, wanted to harm <span class="greek">βλάπτειν</span> the seed <span class="greek">σπέρμα</span> which will be upon the earth after the flood <span class="greek">κατακλυσμός</span>. Demons <span class="greek">δαίμων</span> were sent to them, and a deviation <span class="greek">πλάνη</span> of the winds, and a burden <span class="greek">βάρος</span> of the angels <span class="greek">ἄγγελος</span>, and a fear of the prophet <span class="greek">προφήτης</span>, a condemnation <span class="greek">κατάγνωσις</span> of speech, that <span class="greek">ἵνα</span> I may teach you, O <span class="greek">ὦ</span> Shem, from what blindness your race <span class="greek">γενεά</span> is saved.

					<p class="english">This is the paraphrase <span class="greek">παράφρασις</span>: For <span class="greek">γάρ</span> you did not remember that it is from the firmament <span class="greek">στερέωμα</span> that your race <span class="greek">γενεά</span> has been saved. Elorchaios is the name of the great Light, the place from which I have come, the Word <span class="greek">λόγος</span> which has no equal, and the likeness is my honored garment. Derderkeas is [ ], the one who spoke in the voice of the Light. And Strophaia is the blessed glance which is the Spirit <span class="greek">πνεῦμα</span>. And it is Chelkeach, who is my garment, who has come from the astonishment <span class="greek">θαῦμα</span>; it is he who was in the cloud of the Hymen <span class="greek">ὑμήν</span> having appeared as a trimorphic <span class="greek">μορφή</span> cloud. And Chelkea is my garment which is bimorphic <span class="greek">μορφή</span>; it is he who was in the cloud of Silence. And Chelke is my garment which was given him from every region <span class="greek">μέρος</span>; it was given him in a single form <span class="greek">εἶδος</span> by the greatness; it is he who was in the cloud of the middle region <span class="greek">μεσότης</span>. And the star of the Light which was mentioned is my invincible garment which I wore <span class="greek">φορεῖν</span> in Hades; this (i.e., the star of the Light) is the mercy which surpasses the thought and the testimony <span class="greek">μαρτυρία</span> of those who bear witness <span class="greek">μαρτυρεῖν</span>. And the testimony <span class="greek">μαρτυρία</span> was mentioned: the First and the Last, faith <span class="greek">πίστις</span>, the mind <span class="greek">νοῦς</span> of the wind of darkness. And Sophaia and Saphaina are in the cloud of those who have been separated from the chaotic fire. And the righteous <span class="greek">δίκαιος</span> Spark <span class="greek">σπινθήρ</span> is the cloud of light which has shone in your (pl.) midst. For <span class="greek">γάρ</span> in it my garment will go down to chaos <span class="greek">χαός</span>.</p>
